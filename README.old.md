## Description

PlotTwist is a social media platform where registered users may share posts containing text and images with other users. Users can interact with existing posts through reactions and comments, and they can edit and delete any post they have created themselves. Users may visit and edit their own profile page in order to express themselves how they like. They may also visit other users profile pages. Users may follow and unfollow other profiles, and they may see who follows them. The project focuses on design and frontend development.

## To sum up the steps of the project

I have learned a lot over the last 2 years, and this is very much reflected in the steps I took along the way for this project. I feel confident in how I plan a project for myself, and I find the steps along the way, through planning, working on the design, user testing, adjusting and coding, logical and natural now that I have been through them several times over the course of the study. Any relevant files not included in Moodle (competitor research, personas, style tile, report etc.) can be found under assets in this repo, as well as in the appropriate card in Trello.

I chose the name PlotTwist for my site, because I love how social media can contribute to changing the narrative in the world.

### Planning

This project stretched over 7 weeks, meaning that planning has been an important factor for ensuring that nothing is forgotten along the way. I used Trello for my day-to-day planning, and a Gannt chart to plan for the bigger picture over the entirety of the project.

### Design

As part of planning my design, I delved into some [competitor research](https://xd.adobe.com/view/63dcb8a1-3652-4f55-9981-5f6ad13f22f1-368f/) to see what trends and gaps I could find within the social media market. I then created [personas](https://xd.adobe.com/view/0bf0a014-03fd-4e31-b70e-2e66bb3c46cf-5ea3/) and wireframes, before user testing my initial ideas on someone in the target audience. Then, I created a [style tile](https://xd.adobe.com/view/71e98386-a629-4d53-afc9-9733b6639af5-24ba/) for myself, to help guide me through the rest of the design process. I created a [prototype](https://xd.adobe.com/view/d75d7ed7-d625-45df-984b-e91f673efc82-820e/), did some user testing, updated my design and eventually ended up with a set of finished sketches that I could base my finished project on.

#### Important findings from competitor research and user testing

- Site should be clean, modern and uncluttered.

- Posts and user content needs to be the main focus.

- Users are expecting a certain layout on profiles and feed.

- Users are expecting to be able to navigate through linked avatar/usernames/content etc.

- Users want to get a quick overview, easily being able to see the number of comments/reactions/followers/followings.

### Code

Finally I built the site. Initially, I focused on making sure my api requests came through correctly, getting familiar with the api and documentation. I have used Postman and the browser's dev tools a lot through this project to ensure I understand any error that pops up. Once I could see that the main content was coming through, I went on to look at comments, reactions, avatars, banners, tags and other parts of the api that required a little extra attention in order to work correctly. Finally, I added styling, tweaking and changing the layout and design where relevant.

Working with a shared school API has been interesting, and new problems pop up every now and then because someone posts something to the API that do not work (broken images, strings with no spaces/breaks etc.). At times it has been a little demotivating to see only empty users and posts saying “Test”, instead of believable content. Still, I have gained a lot of understanding and experience through this project, and I have overall found it really interesting and fun to work with. I believe this projects sums up the last 2 years in a good way.
